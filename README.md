# Weather_Station_Explore
The code here is used to organize and display daily weather data from my personal weather station.
<br/>Current programs and their purpose:
<br/>-Data_Explore.py This program will take a raw data dump file and sort it out into the appropriate data fields and output daily .csv files.
<br/>-Data_Visualization.py This program inputs a daily .csv file, does a data check on wind gusts, stores daily states for each parameter, and prints out data graphics.
